## Skill

- React

  - All components are **functional components** with hooks.

  - **css**: CSS-in-JS(`styled-components`)

  - **Form action**, **state management**: use basic feature(prop drilling, useState)

    -> because this site doesn't need a lot of common state use. So, I use just 1 additional css library.

- Typescript

  - use 2 basic types(`todoType`, `selectedMenuType`) and basic type definitions(interface for props, function arguments).
